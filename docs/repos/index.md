# About Lumito's repos

In this section, you'll see the documentation for my projects. Most of them are available on my GitHub account ([github.com/LumitoLuma](https://github.com/LumitoLuma)).

Also, there will be other repositories that aren't on my GitHub account, such as Wget2 for Windows and avr-gcc releases.

Use the left menu to navigate into my repo's pages, and the bottom right button to go to the next page.

**Hope you enjoy my repositories!**
